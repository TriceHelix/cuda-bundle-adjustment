# cuda-bundle-adjustment
A CUDA implementation of Bundle Adjustment

## Description
This project implements a Bundle Adjustment algorithm with CUDA.
It optimizes camera poses and landmarks (3D points) represented by a graph.

The reference CPU implementation is [RainerKuemmerle/g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o).
This project is designed to provide following g2o features, which are commonly used in Visual SLAM.

- `g2o::BlockSolver_6_3`
- `g2o::OptimizationAlgorithmLevenberg`
- `g2o::VertexSE3Expmap`
- `g2o::VertexSBAPointXYZ`
- `g2o::EdgeSE3ProjectXYZ`
- `g2o::EdgeStereoSE3ProjectXYZ`

For example, see [Use cuda-bundle-adjustment in ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/fixstars/cuda-bundle-adjustment/wiki/Use-cuda-bundle-adjustment-in-ORB-SLAM2).

## Performance

The performance obtained from `sample/sample_comparison_with_g2o` is as follows.

#### `Settings`

Key|Value
---|---
CPU / implementation|Core-i7 6700K(4.00 GHz) / g2o
GPU / implementation|GeForce GTX 1080 / cuda-bundle-adjustment
number of iterations for optimization|10

#### `Results`
input filename|P|L|E|CPU[sec]|GPU[sec]
---|---|---|---|---|---
ba_kitti_07.json|248|26127|95037|1.8|0.23
ba_kitti_00.json|1332|133383|561116|11.9|1.23

**P**: number of poses, **L**: number of landmarks, **E**: number of edges

## Limitations
Some features supported in g2o are currently simplified or not implemented.

- Information matrix is represented by a scalar
- Camera parameters are associated with each of the pose vertices (not each of the edges)
- Level optimization is not implemented

## Requirement
- CMake
- CUDA (with compute capability >= 6.0)
- Eigen
- OpenCV (for sample)
- g2o (for sample, optional)

## How to build
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fixstars/cuda-bundle-adjustment.git
$ cd cuda-bundle-adjustment
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

With `WITH_G2O` option, you can run `sample/sample_comparison_with_g2o`.
[g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) needs to be installed beforehand.

```
cmake -DWITH_G2O=ON ..
```

With `USE_FLOAT32` option, 32bit float is used in internal floating-point operations (default is 64bit float).
Currently there is no significant speedup by this option.

```
cmake -DUSE_FLOAT32=ON ..
```

## How to run samples

First, extract input graph files.

```
$ cd cuda-bundle-adjustment/samples
$ 7za x ba_input.7z
```

input filename|description
---|---
ba_kitti_07.json|graph components sampled from `KITTI sequences/07` using [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)
ba_kitti_00.json|graph components sampled from `KITTI sequences/00` using [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)

Then, pass to the sample code.

```
$ cd cuda-bundle-adjustment/build
$ ./samples/sample_ba_from_file/sample_ba_from_file ../samples/ba_input/ba_kitti_00.json
```
